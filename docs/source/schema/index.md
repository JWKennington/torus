# TORUS Schema Components

This page details the components of the TORUS schema. The schema is implemented as an abstract specification, allowing for the underlying data to be stored in human-readable formats such as TOML, YAML, and JSON. The python utilities in the pytorus package provide both an object-relational mapping for TORUS scheme elements as well as a set of tools for validation of scheme elements.
