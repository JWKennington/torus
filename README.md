# Topic Reference Unified Schema: `torus`

The TORUS project is a collection of tools and libraries for working with subject matter references, including articles,
books, and other relevant media. The design of TORUS is compatible with existing reference formats, such as BibTeX; however,
TORUS provides additional functionality for working with collections of references, such as "reading lists" for academic
topic areas. Using TORUS, it is possible to:

- Import/export references from/to a variety of sources, including BibTeX, DOI, and other reference formats.
- Create and manage reading lists for academic topics.
- Add arbitrary metadata to references, such as notes, tags, difficulty scores, and ratings.
